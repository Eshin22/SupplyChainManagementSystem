# üì¶ Supply Chain Management System

## üìñ Project Overview
The **Supply Chain Management System** is designed for **Company A**, a production company based in Kandy. The system supports logistics management, coordinating the distribution of products across Sri Lanka through an integrated railway and truck delivery network. With automated scheduling for drivers and detailed reporting, the system enhances efficiency and decision-making for the company‚Äôs operations.

## üöÄ Project Description

Company A manages orders from wholesalers, retailers, and end customers across various regions. Key components of the system include:

- **Railway-Based Distribution**: Orders are transported from the factory to storage facilities located in major cities (Colombo, Negombo, Galle, Matara, Jaffna, Trinco) via an allocated railway capacity. If order volumes exceed the allocated train capacity, the system reschedules the excess orders for the next available trip.

- **Truck-Based Final Mile Delivery**: From each city‚Äôs storage facility, orders are distributed to customer locations via trucks following predefined routes. These routes ensure full coverage of each city‚Äôs area, with delivery times predefined for each route.

- **Driver and Assistant Scheduling**: Each truck is assigned a driver and assistant, scheduled according to the following rules:
  - **Drivers**: Cannot be scheduled for consecutive shifts; maximum work hours capped at 40 hours/week.
  - **Assistants**: Can be scheduled for up to two consecutive shifts; maximum work hours capped at 60 hours/week.
  - Rosters are auto-generated based on these constraints to ensure fair workload distribution.

- **Customer Order Placement**: Customers must place orders at least 7 days in advance. Orders can be scheduled along specific routes, allowing customers to select the route nearest to their delivery location.

- **Comprehensive Reporting**: The system includes reports for management insights, including:
  - **Quarterly Sales Reports** for a specified year.
  - **Most Ordered Items** to identify popular products.
  - **Sales by City and Route** to highlight geographic and route-specific performance.
  - **Work Hours Reports** for drivers, assistants, and truck usage.
  - **Customer Order Summaries** for tracking orders and customer activity.
